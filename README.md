# IDEA Settings

This repo attempts to standardize Intellij IDEA settings across AIQ developers.

### Import

File > Settings Repository > Input this repo's URL > Overwrite local

### Code Style Only

Scared to import all the settings? Me too! 

The most important setting here is the code style setting. To import only this setting:

Preferences > Editor > Code Style > Scala > wheel next to "Scheme" > Import Scheme > Navigate to [ActionIQ.xml](codestyles/ActionIQ.xml)

Wa-la! Code your little AIQ heart out.
